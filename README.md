# WalkScore AI

WalkScore AI is a web application that calculates and displays walkability scores for different areas based on real-time data. It leverages Firebase for authentication and data storage, integrates with Google Maps APIs for location and amenity data, and uses Leaflet for interactive mapping.

## Features

- **Walkability Score Calculation:**  
  Uses custom logic along with real Google Maps data (via the Places API) to compute walkability scores based on factors like sidewalk quality, crosswalk safety, lighting, transit, and air quality.

- **Interactive Map:**  
  Displays user location, destination markers, scenic views, and walkability score markers on an interactive map built with Leaflet.

- **User Authentication & Reporting:**  
  Allows users to sign up, log in, and report issues, with Firebase Authentication and Firestore managing user data and reports.

- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:**  
  Supports a toggle for switching between dark and light themes.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Scenic Routes:**            
  You can customize paths depending on how you would like your routes to be! e.g. Fastest, Safest, Scenic, and Assessible.
